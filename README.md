# Programming Languages module-2

This is the first part of my exam for the course "Programming languages module 2" at UniTn. This module of the course was about programming languages in general and functional programming using Standard ML (SML). <br>

Since this solution was correct and passed every test scenario, I got to continue to the second part of the exam, which was the actual exam.
